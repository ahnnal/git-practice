1. [pwd]: this command shows the path in a directory -> $ pwd
2. [cd]: this command changes the directory -> $ cd
3. [ls]: this command lists files and directories -> $ ls
>argument : [directory name] / root [directory name] . current directory 
[directory name] ~ home of current user ..etc

option

- -l : show detailed information (long format)
- -lh : same as above, but size in units 

#### ls's commands
---

- ls : lists files and directories
- ls /bin : it's like ls but difference is that ls /bin lists in /bin directory
- ls -l : list files and directories in the working directoru in long format 
- ..etc

---

tip1 : files and directories's names are so long ....... use tab key! type the directory's first spell and use the tab key . That action will make the full spell about the directory

tip2 : up arrow key recalls the used directory before

tip3 : your git bash shell is messy , use $ clear
